The Projects uses transferlearning for the training of the data. The are 2 classes of the data which are NORMAL and PNUEMONIA. The Choosen Architecture is the ResNet18 archtecture. The library that is ustilize is pytorch which is use for the model development.Data Preprocessing technques such as Data Augmentation is use in this projects.  The project also demonstrates the model capabilities by demonstratiing it in web application.
